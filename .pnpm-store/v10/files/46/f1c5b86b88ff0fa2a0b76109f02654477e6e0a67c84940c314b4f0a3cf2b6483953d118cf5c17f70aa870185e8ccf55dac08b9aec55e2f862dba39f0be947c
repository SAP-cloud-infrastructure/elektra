/**
 * The `PageHeader` component renders a header for an application with customisable `logo`, `title` and other options.
 * Ideally, the custom logo component should return an `<img />` or an inline `<svg>` element.
 * When using SVG, ensure the file is optimized to eliminate any superfluous elements or data that can contribute to increased file size and reduced performance. `Svgo` is a great tool to optimize `svg` files. Make sure the `viewBox` element is not removed when optimizing a file for usage a a header logo.
 * Pass as prop to `AppShell` so it gets slotted into the correct place in the layout. If building your layout manually without `AppShell` place as first child of AppBody.
