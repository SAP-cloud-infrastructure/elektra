/**
A generic Modal component.

The Modal component can automatically create cancelling and confirming buttons with the desired labels and handlers.

For more complex use cases, more buttons, etc., an instance of `<ModalFooter>` with all custom content as children can be passed as prop `modalFooter` and will be rendered.

The Modal uses a boolean 'open' prop to determine whether it is open or not. Alternatively, the open state can be handled outside the component, e.g. in a global state. In this case the 'open' prop needs to be passed as true always, otherwise the Modal component will not render.

By default, the modal will close (i.e. set its `open` state to false) once the user cancels the Modal. When confirming, you will have to either set the `open` to false to close the modal, or use whatever global state mechanism you have to handle modals.

To make the modal less intrusive and effectively un-modal it, pass `closeOnBackdropClick`. This will close the modal when the user clicks the modal backdrop.
