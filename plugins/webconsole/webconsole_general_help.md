### What is this?
This is the CCloud EE Shell-as-a-Service offering. We provide every user with their own interactive shell already scoped
to the current context with the correct permissions in place. All necessary tools for interacting with the IaaS layer 
are preinstalled and preconfigured. Now you don't need to install and configure the respective CLI tools on your
local machine anymore to be able to use them.
