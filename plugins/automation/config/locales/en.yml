This allows you to inspect the bundled automation artifacts, modify them and run the automation manually. Enabling debug mode for an extended period of time can exhaust  your instances disk space as each automation run will leave a directory behind. Also be aware that the payload may contain secrets which are persisted to disk indefinitely when debug mode is enabled."
