#### What is Audit Log?

The Audit Log feature offers a comprehensive audit trail and change log for Converged Cloud services.

It captures audit-relevant activities and stores them in a project-specific journal. Within this journal, each recorded activity is represented by an audit event. These events detail the performed action, its outcome, and the affected resources.

This service isn't exclusively for auditors. It's a valuable tool for conducting root-cause analysis when encountering configuration issues, such as downtimes. The information provided by audit events significantly simplifies the process of distinguishing between human errors and platform malfunctions.

Currently, the system only records Keystone events. However, additional sources will be incorporated incrementally in the future.
