Feature: Multi Domain Authentication
  In order to test that the user can be logged in in several OpenStack domains at the same time
  I want to check the multi domain authentication

  Scenario: User signs in in two Openstack domains simultaneously
    Given I am not logged in in domain1
     And I am not logged in in domain2
    When I visit domain1 home page
    Then I am redirected to domain1 login page
    When I log in as test_user
    Then I am redirected to domain1 home page
     And the session path is domain1
    When I visit domain2 home page
    Then I am redirected to domain2 login page
    When I log in as test_user
    Then I am redirected to domain2 home page
     And the session path is domain2
    When I visit domain1 home page
    Then I see the domain1 home page

  Scenario: When the user logs out in a domain all other domain sessions remain intact
    Given I am not logged in in domain1
     And I am not logged in in domain2
     And I visit domain1 home page
     And I am redirected to domain1 login page
     And I log in as test_user
     And I am redirected to domain1 home page
     And I visit domain2 home page
     And I am redirected to domain2 login page
     And I log in as test_user
     And I am redirected to domain2 home page
    When I logout from domain2
     And I visit domain1 home page
    Then I see the domain1 home page

  Scenario: Session ID is not affected by logout in other domain
    Given I am not logged in in domain1
     And I visit domain1 home page
     And I am redirected to domain1 login page
     And I log in as test_user
     And I am redirected to domain1 home page
     And I notice the session id
     And I am not logged in in domain2
     And I visit domain2 home page
     And I am redirected to domain2 login page
     And I log in as test_user
     And I am redirected to domain2 home page
    When I logout from domain2
     And I visit domain1 home page
    Then I see the domain1 home page
     And the session id didn't change
